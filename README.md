### Analysis:<br>
There is a positive correlation between Happiness and all three priorities chosen. These were seen in the regression lines and the r values. Saftey's R-value: 0.35, Cost of Living's R-value: 0.74, Local Purchasing Power's R-value: 0.74.<br>
This makes sense because happiness and safety have a psychological correlation. Security and safety tend t go hand in hand. 
Also, the value of one's money positively correlates with happiness. If people's hard-earned money goes further into buying things that they not only need but also want, then they tend to be happier. <br>

The z-score shows that not all the points were clustered around the mean. We had many that were within two to three standard deviations away. This lets us know that the priorities we are analyzing do have an impact on where one would want to invest and visit as a tourist.<br>

The histograms, again prove that some countries prioritize different things compared to others, and all that has an effect on their happiness. The histograms also gave us a narrowed list of countries to further investigate.<br>

We then took these countries and plotted the percent GDP change from the previous year for 40 years. There were a few outliers since some economies have changed drastically from the 1980s until now. We also narrowed in on the last 5 years and can clearly see the impact that the pandemic had on a global scale, even though only our top 17 countries are represented.<br>

Further analysis would need to be taken in order to pinpoint any trends in real estate, population, infrastructure, tourist attractions, and exchange rates depending on whether the client is a Real Estate Investment Company or a Travel Agency.<br>
